I was an American author who achieved posthumous fame through my influential works of horror fiction. I was virtually unknown and published only in pulp magazines before I died in poverty, but I am now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in my genre. I was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where I spent most of my life. I was never able to support myself from earnings as author and editor. I saw commercial success increasingly elude me in this latter period, partly because I lacked the confidence and drive to promote myself. I subsisted in progressively strained circumstances in my last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time that I died at age 46.
